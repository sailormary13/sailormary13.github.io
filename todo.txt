    images, especially for sail fast and quiz editor.
    headings, like challenge/goal/process/results.
    change TDS content to specific projects like TDS Careers and TDS Marketing Campaigns and TDS Help & Support
make sure images are compressed.
link images and titles under featured work.
fav-icon.
