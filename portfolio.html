                    CrewFinder

Summary
CrewFinder helps sailors find crew so that they can spend less time on logistics and more time out on the water. This app could be used by any sort of organization that wants to help its members organize group events, but this example was applied to the Hoofer Sailing Club in Madison, WI. Hoofers has over 1,000 members and many different types of boats that all have different crew requirements.

How it works
It can be difficult find other people to take out a sailboat with, so this program has users create events so that other users can sign up as crew. A user fills out certain information about the event they are creating and then the event is displayed chronologically on the events page.

Cool features
Each boat at Hoofers has a maximum number of crew allowed. This number was programmed in for each boat type and is displayed as “open spots” for each event. When a user signs up, the number of “open spots” decreases by one. Once “open spots” hits zero, no more users can sign up as crew.

A list of crew is displayed for each event, and users can easily remove themselves from the list with the Remove button. However the user can back-out out of the Remove action before it is finalized.

A user can easily edit or remove their event. Again, there is a back-out option for the user.

Shout out to Ken Marks.

TDS Web
I’m currently working as a Digital Operations intern at TDS, a Fortune 1000 telecommunications company that services customers throughout the country. I wear many hats, but so far my job has consisted of designing, developing, and maintaining TDS’s web presence, mainly through their main customer-facing websites: tdstelecom.com, hellotds.com, and bendbroadband.com. I also work on SEO and web analytics. I use data from Google Analytics and internal sources to create reports that provide insight into web performance and conversion rates.

Another huge benefit of this position is that I get to work closely with other departments, such as Consumer Marketing and IT. This experience has shown me how departments and teams communicate and work together to successfully complete projects.

Software / Languages / Skills that I Use on the Job
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Google Analytics
Adobe Creative Suite: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign
Adobe Experience Manager (CMS)
User Experience (user stories, flows)
QA Testing
JIRA / Confluence
Microsoft Excel

Shout out to my amazing team.

UX Design
I am supplementing my Software Development courses with some courses over in the Design school, namly Computer Graphics and UX Design. I am very motivated by the user experience and creating seamless, intuitive interactions for the user

I am learning a ton about UX Design right now, including user research, user interviews, competitive analysis, empathy maps, and user personas. It’s so user-focused, and I love it. As far as software goes, I’m using Sketch and the Adobe Creative Suite.

Shout out to Phillip McKeown

FileAnalyzer
This is the name of the project we’re working on in my Advanced Java course. It is aptly named; it is a program that analyzes files. There are several iterations of this program throughout the course, but Iteration One reads files, counts the number of words, the number of distinct words, and then creates some output files containing this data. Interesting classes that I used included Reader, Writer, and Collections. I’m currently working on Iteration Two, which incorporates servlets, web apps, and more. I’m looking forward to seeing where we take this.

I enjoy object-oriented programming, probably because it makes me nostalgic for abstract algebra and other math courses I took as an undergrad.

Shout out to Paula Waite.

Modern JavaScript
This is my favorite class this semester. We’re covering a lot, including Angular, TypeScript, two-way binding, MVVM, lambda expressions, JSON, and Git/GitHub. I find it all to be good fun, and I’m extremely interested in these topics.

Shout out to Tom Steele.

Agile Development
My teacher / manager / leader background has primed me nicely to lead my own dev team someday, and I’m finding my Systems Analysis class to be very useful in pursuing this goal. In Systems Analysis, we’re launching Agile projects with user role modeling, user story mapping (More user-centered practices?! You know I like it.), and planning poker. I’ve learned to “estimate quickly and track mercilessly”, utilizing burn down/burn up charts to track and communicate progress.

Communication is very important to me. Specifically, I really care that everyone has a voice and that we all have a shared understanding of the task at hand.

Shout out to Tom Steele.

This Website
Hey, this is surely a work in progress, but I’ve come a long way since my first web page in 1999. (Remember the marquees cruising across the screen? Remember the colors and backgrounds? Frames? Dollz? Colorful scrollbars? What a time to be alive.)

There’s more to come, and I plan to update regularly.
