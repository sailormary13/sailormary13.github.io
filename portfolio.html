                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>The client was a director of global agricultural research, and all she gave me was a sad PDF newsletter, a logo, and some very loose ideas for a website, but after many interviews and iterations with content wireframes, I was able to elucidate the client’s key needs: highlight stories of researchers doing global work, report news and other announcements, and create a search-able repository of faculty doing global research. Prioritzing content strategy and site architecture from the beginning made design and development easier later in the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>I mapped out the project tasks and created a digital KANBAN-style board in our project management software to manage and communicate the work for this project, sought feedback throughout the process, and communicated with all parties. I scoped and prioritized work to meet our holiday deadline, and solicited and implemented feedback along the way.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to managing the project, I was also the primary UX designer and developer, creating custom React components for Wordpress's Gutenberg editor. I also provided CMS and Google Analytics training to the client. This project was a huge success, and I particularly enjoyed it because I was the master orchestrator, and we built up something amazing from basically nothing.

                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>The College of Agricultural & Life Sciences has a new priority: get more students to major in a CALS major, resulting in more $$ from the university (the ultimate goal). The college has no marketing department and a precendent of focusing on research instead of undergrads, so they drastically need help. Hence I took charge of the Academics Website Re-Design project to make an engaging user experience that would attract more undergrads.

                                <li>Template provides structure for folks who have never thought about web content strategy before or how to market themselves/their work</li>
                                <li>Template ensures consistency across the many content areas</li>

                    <p>
                        SailFast helps competitive sailing programs and teams get organized, communicate logistics, create lineups, and ultimately improve their performance on the race course.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The development process involved user research, user interviews, competitive analysis, empathy maps, user personas, and low-fidelity and hi-fidelity wireframes.
                        I also designed the color scheme, typography, and imagery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After initial user testing on the wireframe, I made a styled prototype in Sketch. Users can navigate around the product as if it were fully developed software.
                        I ran two iterations of user testing on the prototype, using the results to improve its usability.

                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>CrewFinder helps sailors find crew so that they can spend less time on logistics and more time out on the water. This app is for any organization to help its members plan group events, but this example was applied to the Hoofer Sailing Club in Madison, WI. Hoofers has over 1,000 members and many different types of boats that all have different crew requirements. I designed and develpped this entire app, from database design to front-end styles.</p>

                <h4>How it works</h4>
                <p>It's difficult to organize a group of people to go sailing, so this program has users create events that other users can sign up for as crew. A user fills out certain information about the event they are creating and then the event is displayed chronologically on the events page.
                </p>

        </div>
        <div class="row portfolio-row">
            <div class="col-md-7 my-auto">
                <h4>Cool features</h4>
                    <p>Each boat at Hoofers has a maximum number of crew allowed. This number is displayed as “open spots” for each event. When a user signs up, the number of “open spots” decreases by one. Once “open spots” hits zero, no more users can sign up for the event.
                    </p>
                    <p>A list of crew is displayed for each event, and users can easily remove themselves from the list with the Remove button. However the user can back-out out of the Remove action before it is finalized.
                    </p>
                    <p>A user can easily edit or remove their event. Again, there is a back-out option for the user.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>I developed a Quiz Editor application using Angular, TypeScript, two-way binding, JSON, MVVM, RESTful web servies, and Git/GitHub. The app loads in previously saved quizzes. You can pick one of those to edit or create a new quiz. (This project was made for a Modern JavaScript + Frameworks class I took in 2018. In this class, I also made a mini Star Wars app using the Ionic framework and SWAPI, the Star Wars API. Too much fun.)</p>

                    <p>Although I love programming and design, my talents really shine when I am managing projects. I am like a conductor of an orchestra as I map out projects, write briefs, create and assign tasks, and partcipate in Scrums. A great teacher once taught me "estimate quickly and track mercilessly", and this principle has produced exceptional results for me.</p>

                <div class="col-md-7 my-auto">
                    <p>Besides thorough tracking and documentation, I also priortize understanding the client's needs and understanding the entire vision for the project. Similarly, a good project manager must understand the user's perspective (user stories and personas!). As a project manager, I understand how the puzzle pieces (AKA tasks) fit together to produce the entire digital experience. Being detail oriented yet a conceptual thinker makes me excel at this.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, communication and transparency are key. I am a relentless communicator. (It definitely helps that I love people and working on teams.) I'm never afraid to ask a question, and I also seek feedback because all feedback is good feedback and will result in a better final product. From email to meetings to GitHub to PM software, I'm comfortable and confident working in all communication channels and have a history of getting projects done and producing exceptional work.</p>
