                <h3>CrewFinder</h3>
                <img src="./images/crewFinderSnap.png" alt="screenshot of events page listing sailing events" class="img-fluid portfolio-img">
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>CrewFinder helps sailors find crew so that they can spend less time on logistics and more time out on the water. This app could be used by any sort of organization that wants to help its members organize group events, but this example was applied to the Hoofer Sailing Club in Madison, WI. Hoofers has over 1,000 members and many different types of boats that all have different crew requirements.</p>

                <h4>How it works</h4>
                <p>It can be difficult find other people to take out a sailboat with, so this program has users create events so that other users can sign up as crew. A user fills out certain information about the event they are creating and then the event is displayed chronologically on the events page.
                </p>

                <h4>Cool features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each boat at Hoofers has a maximum number of crew allowed. This number was programmed in for each boat type and is displayed as “open spots” for each event. When a user signs up, the number of “open spots” decreases by one. Once “open spots” hits zero, no more users can sign up as crew.
                    </li>
                    <li>A list of crew is displayed for each event, and users can easily remove themselves from the list with the Remove button. However the user can back-out out of the Remove action before it is finalized.
                    </li>
                    <li>A user can easily edit or remove their event. Again, there is a back-out option for the user.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Details</h4>
                <p>I created this app for my PHP Web Development class in Spring 2018. My favorite part of projects like this is doing high-level design because I must anticipate and understand the back-end and front-end requirements of each feature and how they all relate and connect to create the project as a whole. I used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>MySQL</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Cloud9</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Shout out to Ken Marks.</p>

                <h3>TDS Web</h3>

                <img src="./images/tdsSnap.png" alt="screenshot of TDS internet page" class="img-fluid portfolio-img">
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>I’m currently working as a Digital Operations intern at TDS, a Fortune 1000 telecommunications company that services customers throughout the country. I wear many hats, but so far my job has consisted of designing, developing, and maintaining TDS’s web presence, mainly through their main customer-facing websites: tdstelecom.com, hellotds.com, and bendbroadband.com. I also work on SEO and web analytics. I use data from Google Analytics and internal sources to create reports that provide insight into web performance and conversion rates.</p>

                <p>Another huge benefit of this position is that I get to work closely with other departments, such as Consumer Marketing and IT. This experience has shown me how departments and teams communicate and work together to successfully complete projects.</p>

                <h4>Software / Languages / Skills that I Use on the Job</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>Bootstrap</li>
                    <li>Responsive Design</li>
                    <li>Google Analytics
                    <li>Adobe Creative Suite: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign</li>
                    <li>Adobe Experience Manager (CMS)</li>
                    <li>User Experience (user stories, flows)</li>
                    <li>QA Testing</li>
                    <li>JIRA / Confluence</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Shout out to my amazing team.</p>

                <img src="./images/userPersonaSnap.png" alt="user persona of Kristin with picture and details" class="portfolio-img">
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>I am supplementing my Software Development courses with some courses over in the Design school, namly Computer Graphics and UX Design. I am very motivated by the user experience and creating seamless, intuitive interactions.</p>

                <p>Right now I am designing an app for helping sailors and sailing programs organize their crew and plan for races and regattas. This process has involved user research, user interviews, competitive analysis, empathy maps, and user personas. It’s so user-focused, and I love it. As far as software goes, I’m using Sketch and the Adobe Creative Suite.</p>

                <h3>FileAnalyzer</h3>
                <img src="./images/fileAnalyzerSnap.png" alt="screenshot of code editor and command line" class="portfolio-img">
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>This is the project I’m working on in my Advanced Java course. It is aptly named; it is a program that analyzes files. There are several iterations of this program throughout the course, but Iteration One reads files, counts the number of words, the number of distinct words, and then creates some output files containing this data. Interesting classes that I used included Reader, Writer, and Collections. I’m currently working on Iteration Two, which incorporates servlets, web apps, and more. I’m looking forward to seeing where we take this. </p>

                <p>I enjoy object-oriented programming because I like the levels of abstraction.</p>

                <p>Shout out to Paula Waite.</p>

                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>This is my favorite class this semester. We’re covering a lot, including Angular, TypeScript, two-way binding, MVVM, lambda expressions, JSON, and Git/GitHub. I find it all to be good fun, and I’m extremely interested in these topics.</p>

                <p>Shout out to Tom Steele.</p>

                <h3>Agile Development</h3>
                <img src="./images/burnUpChartSnap.png" alt="screenshot of excel data and charts showing work completed over time" class="portfolio-img">
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>My teacher / manager / leader background has primed me nicely to lead my own dev team someday, and I’m finding my Systems Analysis class to be very useful in pursuing this goal. In Systems Analysis, we’re launching Agile projects with user role modeling, user story mapping (More user-centered practices?! You know I like it.), and planning poker. I’ve learned to “estimate quickly and track mercilessly”, utilizing burn down/burn up charts to track and communicate progress.</p>

                <p>Communication is very important to me. Specifically, I really care that everyone has a voice and that we all have a shared understanding of the task at hand.</p>
